# U232-Torrent-Downloader
This script should come in handy when someone is looking to change/upgrade their torrent client server.  What it will do is login to site, go to mytorrents page, and download all the torrents you have uploaded to your site to the server watch directory.  This should save you time and make the process easier.  If you find any issues or see something that can be improved please let me know.

Edit paths, site link, and quick login.
